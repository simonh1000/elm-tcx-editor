# Tcx file viewer (Elm version)

Provides a view of .tcx files resulting from the use of Garmin GSP files, e.g. for cycling.

Project provides examples of
- file uploading, data downloading
- complex, nested json decoding
- Port communication with Google maps (based on map zoom level sent back to Elm, the program calculates how many data points to draw)
- SPA-like behaviour with switching of view (changing URL makes no sense in this project though)

See [demo](http://tcx-editor.herokuapp.com/elm)
